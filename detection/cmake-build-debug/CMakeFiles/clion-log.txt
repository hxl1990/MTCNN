CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target MTCNN because there
  is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/Users/lixile/Documents/caffe/cmake_build/lib]
    dir 1 is [/usr/local/lib]
      dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [libpython2.7.dylib]
    dir 2 is [/Library/anaconda/lib]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libz.dylib]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
